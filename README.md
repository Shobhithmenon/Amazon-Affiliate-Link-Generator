# Amazon Link Generator

This is a website to generate Amazon links with your tag inside if you are an amazon partner. [Bitly](https://bitly.com/) API is used to shorten the link.
It's built in vanilla JavaScript prevents the importation of jquery (or equivalent) and improves performance


## Installation

You will need to change the variables "tag" and "access_token" with your personal information directly in the JavaScript as follows :

```javascript
var tag = "your_amazon_personal_tag";
var access_token = "your_bitly_personal_access_token";
```

## Improvements

Feel free to request suggestions or bug corrections to improve the project.
